# Hide-and-Seek Behavior Tree
This is a Behavior Tree for a Hide-And-Seek game as part of fulfillment for an Artificial Intelligence course.
The Behavior Tree was created using the asset provided by the [KiwiCoder](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheKiwiCoder) but custom nodes were self-implemented.

One feature that is implemented for the Seeker is vision.

There are two types of vision.
Short vision which has a wider field of view, shorter distance, and detects instantaneously.

Long vision which has a smaller field of view, longer distance, and the detection is delayed simulating how humans need a 
short amount of time to process when seeing objects at a range.

Both of these visions do not work when obscured by an obstacle.

Additionally, the Seeker agent has a small radius in which the agent can detect noise generated by the Hider.
